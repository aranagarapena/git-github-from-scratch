## 🔹 Git & GitHub

1. **Theoretical intuition of Git and GitHub**
   
   - Shows the typical problem of working without version control (multiple “final” versions, confusion when collaborating).  
   - Defines Git as a **distributed version control system** that stores the complete history of a project.  
   - Explains how **local repositories** connect with a **remote server** (GitHub) so developers can share and update the latest version of their code.  
   - Describes the workflow through **Working Directory, Staging Area, Commit, and Push**, using the analogy of preparing and shipping a package.

2. **Install Git and create your first local repository**
   
   - Step-by-step installation of Git on Windows (using Git Bash).  
   - Basic global configuration: username, email, default editor, and line endings.  
   - Verification of the installation inside Visual Studio Code with the Git Bash terminal.  
   - Creation of the first local repository.  
   - Adding files, staging changes, and creating the first commits with clear messages.

3. **Create a remote repository and connect it**
   
   - Introduction to GitHub as a remote server and platform for sharing code.  
   - Step-by-step creation of a new repository on GitHub (public or private).  
   - Linking the local repo with the remote using `git remote add origin <URL>`.  
   - Explanation of `origin`, `main` vs `master`, and the role of branches.  
   - First `git push -u origin main` to upload commits and sync code.

## 🔹 GitHub Pages

4. **Deploying with GitHub Pages (simple)**
   
   - Introduction to GitHub Pages as a free way to publish websites.  
   - Generate a public URL to share your project online.  
   - Configure Pages in repository settings: select branch and folder.  
   - Common use cases: project portfolios and assignment submissions.  
   - Typical errors and waiting time before the site becomes accessible.  
   - 🎥 [Watch video](https://youtu.be/yPCKORk4SdU)

5. **Deploying with GitHub Pages (advanced)**
   
   - Professional workflow using two branches: `development` and `production`.  
   - Make commits and test changes safely in the development branch.  
   - Merge development into production only when the version is ready to publish.  
   - Configure GitHub Pages to deploy exclusively from the production branch.  
   - Demonstration of commits, merges, and publishing flow with Git Graph.

## 🔹 GitHub Classroom

6. **GitHub Classroom workflow for assignments**
   - Introduction to GitHub Classroom and the workflow for assignments.  
   - Accept a task via a shared link and automatically create a private repository.  
   - Clone the repository locally to work on the provided statement and resources.  
   - Commit and push changes so the teacher can review progress.  
   - Receive feedback and comments directly on commits, with deadlines enforced.
